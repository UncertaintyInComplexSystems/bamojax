functionality

- Add prediction functionality to GP/GWP
- Make info object optional, as it takes quite some memory
- Investigate memory consumption more generally
- make some observed nodes 'batchable', and derive loglikeihood_fn accordingly (for stochastic gradient methods)
- Fix the temperature parameter addition for when using SMC with kernels other than Gibbs!

examples

- GWP
- BNN
- GMM, GrMM
- EV
- different regression priors (LN-CASS, horseshoe, spike-and-slab?)
